# sample-portfolio
A redux of my very first site - a sample portfolio for a fictional dev - utilizing a lot of what I learned since I first began. 

The first version was a simple static, non-responsive site. It looked great on a laptop but terrible on a larger screen or a mobile device. I've learned a lot since then, and have applied newly acquired skills to my first project (Flexbox and Bootstrap). I'm a lot happier with the finished version now.
