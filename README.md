# sample-portfolio

HTML, CSS, & Bootstrap

This sample portfolio site for a fictional developer is a redux of my very first project. The original project was neither responsive nor mobile-friendly. I decided to revamp this site recently, this time making it fully responsive using the skills and tools I had acquired since my first attempt. Again, getting the header image to respond the way I wanted it to was a challenge, specifically in landscape mode on a mobile device.
